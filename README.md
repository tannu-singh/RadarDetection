### Radar Object Detection


#### Introduction

In this project I have tried to implement a simple agent based model of radar and objects. For this project I have used simple 2D svg shapes as an objects. There are four objects (I named it as Pillars) and one robot which act as the radar object detector..


#### Working
- When the robot moves around the area or box it is continously emitting radar signals.
- When any object comes in the way of radar signal and extreme end of the wall then the color of the signal changes to red from green.
- The surface area covered from the radar signal is displayed in the canvas window next to the simulation.
